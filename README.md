# Horta-Vertical
It is a code for monitoring and managing a water valve, automating it so that it can irrigate autonomously. The system is turned on to perform the irrigation and while it is on it keeps sending the status of the valve. After turning it off, it spends another 5 minutes sending the status of the valve turned off.
